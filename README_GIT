Branch settings: for generic eclipse/IntelliJ settings

DO NOT DEVELOP IN settings.
To develop, create your own branch (user_activity) 
and merge the branch "settings" (for eclipse/IntelliJ settings)

Serve to compile a full Team-City ClearCase plugin, as view from a master content 
(direct from its original SVN repository)

If evolved, must be against a TCCC from master 
( a 'git rebase master' can be done to move this branch up to more recent SVN updates )

Once the evolution of settings is done, that branch can be merged to any development branch 
in order to import common dev settings

Please check your Git global config:

    $ git config --global --list
    user.name=username
    user.email=username@email.org
    github.user=UserName
    github.token=0123456abc...
    core.autocrlf=false

Check out your github ids in your GitHub profile

Register your local ssh keys in your GitHub profile

    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "username@email.org" -N ""

GIT

.gitignore ignore cls. Maybe bin should be added too.

some aliases are defined within this repository

git st: status
git co: checkout
git ci: commit

ECLIPSE:

YOU HAVE TO EXPLICITELY SET:

$ cat build-standalone.properties
#Path to unpacked .tar.gz distribution or installed .exe distribution of TeamCity
# for example:
#path.variable.teamcitydistribution=C\:/TeamCity4
path.variable.teamcitydistribution=F\:/prog/git/tccc4.5

and, in eclipse, a linked resource called TEAMCITY_HOME (set to for instance F\:prog\git\tccc4.5)

Other than that, import the .project, and all compile, 0 errors, 0 warnings (because most of them are ignored)

To display the external ant builder, go to 'Run/External Tools/Organize Favorite', click Add: the launcher is there.
