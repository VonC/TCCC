Branch vonc_dev: First development by VonC

From full SVN version, add some minor corrections to better understand legacy mechanism

git merge settings has been done (means compile in eclipse or IntelliJ)

Serve to update/compile a full Team-City ClearCase plugin, as view from a master content 
(direct from its original SVN repository)

If evolved, must be against a TCCC from master 
( a 'git rebase master' can be done to move this branch up to more recent SVN updates )

Please check your Git global config:

    user.email=username@email.org
    github.user=UserName
    github.token=0123456abc...

Check out your github ids in your GitHub profile

--------

GIT

.gitignore ignore cls. Maybe bin should be added too.

some aliases are defined within this repository

git st: status
git co: checkout
git ci: commit

--------

ECLIPSE:

YOU HAVE TO EXPLICITELY SET:

$ cat build-standalone.properties
#Path to unpacked .tar.gz distribution or installed .exe distribution of TeamCity
# for example:
#path.variable.teamcitydistribution=C\:/TeamCity4
path.variable.teamcitydistribution=F\:/prog/git/tccc4.5

and, in eclipse, a linked resource called TEAMCITY_HOME (set to for instance F\:prog\git\tccc4.5)

Other than that, import the .project, and all compile, 0 errors, 0 warnings (because most of them are ignored)

To display the external ant builder, go to 'Run/External Tools/Organize Favorite', click Add: the launcher is there.
