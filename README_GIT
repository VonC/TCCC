Branch settings: for generic eclipse/IntelliJ settings

DO NOT DEVELOP IN settings.
To develop, create your own branch (user_activity) 
and merge the branch "settings" (for eclipse/IntelliJ settings)

Serve to compile a full Team-City ClearCase plugin, as view from a master content 
(direct from its original SVN repository)

If evolved, must be against a TCCC from master 
( a 'git rebase master' can be done to move this branch up to more recent SVN updates )

Once the evolution of settings is done, that branch can be merged to any development branch 
in order to import common dev settings
